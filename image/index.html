    Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
    Version control systems are software tools .

    What is Git is a Version Control System or VCS. VCS is basically software designed to record changes within one or
    more
    files over time. It allows us to undo or to cancel all made or pending changes within one or more files. If we're
    working on a project with many files, VCS enables us to control the whole project. If necessary, this allows us to
    revert one or more files any of their previous versions or the whole project to a previous version. We can also
    compare changes to one file between two versions in order to see exactly what was changed in each file, when it was
    changed and who made the change. We can also see why the change was made.

    Why am I mentioning files instead of code? Because Git is a universal system that can be used for version control of
    all types of files, be it Microsoft Word files, pictures, AutoCAD files, Visual Studio Project, etc.

    Types of VCS
    Git is not the only VCS in use. Moreover, Git is just a kind of VCS.

    The types of VCS are:

    Local Version Control System
    Centralized Version Control System
    Distributed Version Control System
    Local Version Control System
    <br><br>
    A local version control system is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is
    stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version. In order to
    see what the file looked like at any given moment, it is necessary to add up all the relevant patches to the file in
    order until that given moment

    Local Version Control System

    A local version control system is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is
    stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version. In order to
    see what the file looked like at any given moment, it is necessary to add up all the relevant patches to the file in
    order until that given moment.

    The main problem with this is that everything is stored locally. If anything were to happen to the local database,
    all the patches would be lost. If anything were to happen to a single version, all the changes made after that
    version would be lost.

    Also, collaborating with other developers or a team is very hard or nearly impossible.
    <br><br>
    Centralized Version Control System
    A centralized version control system has a single server that contains all the file versions. This enables multiple
    clients to simultaneously access files on the server, pull them to their local computer or push them onto the server
    from their local computer. This way, everyone usually knows what everyone else on the project is doing.
    Administrators have control over who can do what.


    disadvantage of the two version control system above:

    when a system crash you will lose ur code sometimes
    but they are also the most beneficial

    (3) Distributed Version Control System

    Distributed Version Control System

    With distributed version control systems, clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files from the
    server, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns
    a local copy of the whole project, i.e. owns their own local database with their own complete history. With this
    model, if the server becomes unavailable or dies, any of the client repositories can send a copy of the project's
    version to any other client or back onto the server when it becomes available. It is enough that one client contains
    a correct copy which can then easily be further distributed.

    Git is the most well-known example of distributed version control systems.
